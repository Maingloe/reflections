Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A:When you want to collaborate with others or if you wanted to create a copy of your work online.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: Because you could be working on a new feature and you wouldnt want new files arriving all the time.
If you do it manualy you can be sure that you want what is on the remote before you decide to pull it.
